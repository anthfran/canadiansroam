      <p>We took a little 2 day trip to Ibiza for the obvious reason of beach and partying.</p>

      <h3>Accommodation</h3>

      <p>We decided to stay at a 3-star resort called Hotel Playasol The New Algarb. They had a per night fee of 180€ and you can pay for all inclusive for an additional 50€. We went for the all inclusive option and feel it was worth the money.</p>

      <p>Our room had a great view of the beach and the sea, although the rest of the room was nothing special. The bed was actually two small single beds and the space was pretty small. We had very noisy neighbours, who were up all night talking and listening to music when we arrived back at the hotel at 530 AM. It didn’t really bother us because it’s Ibiza and expected, we were also very tired and slept through it. I just don’t understand the point of staying in a hotel room when on vacation.</p>

      <p>When going to the bar for drinks, this hotel gives you a chip which you exchange for a cup for a drink. You must bring back your cup to get a new drink, or pay 2€ for a new cup. Some people complained about this in reviews, but I think it’s preferable than providing disposable cups. It’s much more sustainable and creates less waste, I applaud this system even though the real motive is probably financial rather than sustainability.</p>

      <p>The food at lunch and dinner was actually better than I expected. There was lots of English food for the English tourists but I skipped all that and went straight for the Spanish food. They always had a paella and awesome fish dishes. We always ended up eating too much, so the food must have been pretty good.</p>


      <h3>The Beach</h3>

      <p>The Beach is awesome. I’m a fan of electronic music and you can hear some great tunes everywhere you go. Usually I get bored of pop music at beach resorts so this was a nice change. The sand was very soft, which is a welcome change from the pebble and rock beaches of Italy (although Italy’s coast is way more beautiful).</p>

      <h3>Clubbing</h3>

      <p>There are so many options to pick, there are event posters everywhere in the city. We decided to check out Hï Ibiza because two of our favourite DJ’s from South Africa were playing. The music was good, but not as great as I expected mostly because not enough Afro-house was played.</p>

      <p>The venue was pretty cool, really loved the interior design with the moving ceiling that was very unique. Drinks are very expensive, at 15 € each, I’d suggest drinking before entering the venue. Although, nothing is really cheap in Ibiza.</p>


      <h3>Airport Transportation</h3>

      <p>You have two options, a taxi or a bus. We took a bus to the hotel, and a taxi back to the airport.</p>

      <p>There are 3 bus routes and tickets for the bus at 3.50€ per person. One route stopped very close to our hotel on the main strip so we took it and the experience was fine. Note that you purchase tickets right on the bus. I was a bit stressed looking for a ticket machine or booth, just to find out tickets are purchased on the bus.</p>

      <p>We took a taxi back to the airport because it was an early morning flight which cost 10€.</p>
