        <p>Italian food is amazing, but sometimes you crave something different.
          We come from Toronto, Canada where there are many people from different countries who brought their culinary tastes with them.
          Roma has a few gems, if you feel like eating something different than Italian. We'll be documenting a list of our top places to eat.</p>

          description="Yesh is located in the Jewish Ghetto which is a beautiful part of town.
          If you're in the neighbourhood, be sure to walk around Teatro Marcello, Portico d'Ottavia, and the beautiful Synagogue.
          Don't forget to leave the neighbourhood without trying Yesh. Their falafel are smaller than other places, but this makes them better.
          They have a perfect ratio of crunchy outside to soft inside, and are absolutely delicious. The hummus is simple, and tasty.
          If you feel like something meaty, their shwarma is top notch as well."
