        <p>We applied for a VISA through the Italy-Canada youth exchange program, “youth” meaning under 35 years old on the date of application. The application can be found <a href="http://www.constoronto.esteri.it/consolato_toronto/resource/doc/2015/07/workingholidayvisaapplication.pdf">here on the Consulate of Toronto website.</a></p>
        <p>While there are <a href="http://www.constoronto.esteri.it/consolato_toronto/en/i_servizi/per_chi_si_reca_in_italia/pagina_visti_interna_2.html">instructions on their website</a>, however we found them unclear at times. We took too many trips to the consulate because of the unclear instructions, so this guide will help you avoid the mistakes we made by supplementing the guide on the Italian Consoluate’s website.</p>
        <h3>Booking your appointment:</h3>
        <p>The website says: “It is always recommended that you arrange your appointment at least 15 days prior to your departure”. However, they do not tell you that you cannot apply more than 90 days in advance. We went in around 5 months before our departure date so we could plan and we were told to return within 90 days.</p>
        <h3>Getting Travel Medical Insurance:</h3>
        <p>This is a requirement of the VISA, we shopped around and found World Nomads to be the most reasonably priced option. One thing the Italian Consulate will not tell you is to apply for an out province exemption at Service Ontario. You will want to do this for two reasons, the first is you will get better coverage with World Nomads, and the second is Health Ontario will cover you in some emergencies. Applying for the exemption does not cost any money, simply go to a Service Ontario. More information from <a href="http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/publications/ohip/longer_absences.aspx">Service Ontario can be found on their website</a>.</p>
        <h3>Booking Flights:</h3>
        <p>You need to have a flight booked to and from Italy to apply for the VISA. However, if you’re like us and are planning on staying in Italy for 1 year then flights won’t be available. We showed up without a return flight, and the Consulate told us that he could not give us a VISA without a return flight. From the office, we called a travel agent and booked a reservation for a random flight through which did not cost us any money. We had to run out to get a printed copy, don’t make the same mistake we did. Show up with a reservation. Eventually, we ended up cancelling that reservation and booking a flight later that we actually wanted to take.</p>
        <h3>Banking Information:</h3>
        <p>The website says to provide the last 3 bank statements. However, for us that was not enough. The Italian Consulate said the last bank statement was 15 days ago and we also had to print a screenshot of the latest status of our bank accounts.</p>
        <h3>Finding an apartment:</h3>
        <p>You need to have a place to stay in Italy to apply for a VISA. The place can someone you know, temporary residence in a Hotel or Airbnb, or a place you plan to live for the entire year. Expats living in Rome (http://www.expatslivinginrome.com/rooms-for-rent/) has. has We ended up finding a great place on VRBO. We emailed the owner and negotiated a reduced rate and only put a small deposit down before arriving.</p>
        <h3>Picking it up:</h3>
        <p>The VISA is ready pretty quickly, in about a week. They will tell you the day it will be ready and that you don’t need an appointment, but what they won’t tell you is to pick it up at the end of appointments. So, when the appointment hours end around Noon, show up at 11:50.</p>
        <p>We hope these tips help you out when applying for the Schengen Working Holiday VISA. When you arrive in Italy, be sure to apply for your Permisso di Soggiorno.</p>
