<p>This was the first trip we booked even before we moved to Rome.  We planned our visit around the Formula 1 Race and added a few extra days to check out the city.</p>

<p>Since we’ve been living in Rome, we immediately noticed how clean Budapest seemed in comparison.  We didn’t notice a lot of garbage around and the buildings didn’t have graffiti. We were in town during the Fina World Champions, Formula 1, and over a weekend in the summer but the city didn’t seem overcrowded as some other popular cities sometimes feel in the middle of the summer. It seemed to be a very popular spot for Stag/Hen parties as we saw a handful of them and there were also some residents handing out flyers that said “Keep Calm and Stop Throwing Up on Our Doorsteps”.</p>

<p>One thing we will mention though is that we noticed a lot of public peeing in the city. Most by homeless people. There seemed to be a number of them around the city center but they never seemed to bother anyone and we still felt very safe at night.</p>

<p>Budapest is a beautiful city and very affordable. You can easily explore the city and get a taste of it in a few days. If you’re considering visiting Budapest, hopefully this information helps you plan and gives you an idea of the costs. </p>

<h3>Flight</h3>

<p>The flight from Rome to Budapest was 1.5 hours. We booked our flight with Wizzair, which is the Hungarian economy airline.  We were concerned about how strict they would be with luggage size etc, so we made sure we packed super light but no one really seemed to look twice at what we were bringing but I wouldn’t push it or take the chance because things are a lot more expensive if you have to pay at the airport. You are even charged if you have to print out your boarding pass or check-in at the airport, so make sure to do all of that before getting there.</p>

<p>Cost: $353cdn

<h3>Transportation

<p>We took the bus from the airport into the city which was about 1 hour. Budapest recently introduced a direct bus into the city center (100E) but that was a little more (although still very cheap) so we opted to go with the bus (200E) and train transfer. There are ticket machines outside the terminal by the bus stop to buy your ticket. When we went, there were people there assisting, which made it a little easier to figure out which tickets you needed. There are a few different kind of tickets, one for just a single journey and one for a transfer, which gives you 2 tickets. It’s cheaper to get the transfer ticket together. You can also buy on the bus but it’s a bit more expensive and you have to pay in cash with Fornits.  You can pay using your credit card at the machines.

<p>Cost: 1,060Ft or approx $5cdn

<p>Once we got into the city, we walked everywhere, so we didn’t need to use public transportation.  It was a lot of walking in a few days, so if you prefer not to walk as much or the weather isn’t as nice when you visit, the link below has more information on transportation.

<h3>Accommodation

<p>We stayed at an Airbnb in District VI, which was a great location for us.  We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see and do.  Budapest has a lot of affordable accommodations, so it shouldn’t be hard to find something that fits your needs.  We were supposed to have the Airbnb to ourselves but the host had a change of plans so she ended up being there as well but we had a private room and we were only really there to shower and sleep, so we didn’t mind.

Cost: $214cdn for 5 nights

<h3>Activities and Sights




<h3>Food and Drinks

Coming from Rome, we were pretty excited by the variety of food in Budapest. Below are a few of the places we checked out.

Oktagon Bar
http://www.gastlandbisztrok.hu/index.php
One of our first meals was at Oktagon Bar.  It was recommended by our Airbnb host and just a block away from where we were staying, so it was perfect since we were hungry by the time we got into the city and dropped off our stuff.  It is a very simple restaurant, buffet-style and has a lot of traditional Hungarian dishes, so it was a great way to sample a lot of stuff without committing to a whole meal. You have to order a drink but it is still very affordable.

Cost:  3,260Ft or approx. $16cdn

City Park Café or Városliget Café
http://www.varosligetcafe.hu/main-page.html
This was the most expensive restaurant we went to during our trip but it was well worth it. The service was outstanding and the food was delicious. We had a late lunch here and then headed to the Széchenyi Thermal Baths just a short walk away.

Langallo - This is a traditional Hungarian dish described to me when I ordered as similar to a pizza.  Highly recommend


Fried Chicken - everything was very tasty including the potatoes and cucumber salad.

We ordered drinks as well and one thing to keep in mind is that wine is priced by the ounce so you can order as much or as little as you want.

Cost:  10,242Ft ($50cdn)

Budget




Budapest had the fastest moving escalators I’ve ever been on.  Pay attention when you’re getting on and off.
