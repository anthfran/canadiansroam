          description="Trapizzino isn't your typical pizza, is it a sandwich? Is it a pizza pocket?
          No, it's a Trapizzino. They take thick pizza dough, cut it open and fill it with delicious ingridients.
          Every day they have different fillings on offer, so be sure to check it out many times and try them all.
          A typical Trapizzino costs 3.50 € which makes it a pretty cheap quick bite. However, two is very doable for big appetites."

            description="Bonci is not your typical Italian pizza place.
            While they pride themselves on using only natural and fresh ingridients from local and ethical farms, that's not what makes them unusual in Italy.
            Their recipies are not traditional, often packed with lots of strong or unusual flavours you do not find on pizza in Italy.
            Prices are a little higher, they are by weight so it will depend on what you order. Expect to pay 5-6 € per person"

            description="Remo is a busy place, so expect to wait if you are arriving later in the evening. Their pizzas are simple, with one or two toppings.
            Many other Pizzeria on this list do something special with interesting toppings not found else where. However, Remo does simple pizza the best.
            Their house special, of eggplant and mushrooms is okay but I found the moisture from the toppings caused the crust to be a little soggy.
            Personally, I love the sausage (pictured) or the Diavola when in the mood for a spicy kick."

            description="Pepito's made this list for one reason: The Rockerduck (pictured). The rest of the pizza are good, but doesn't really standout in the myriad of Pizzerias in Rome.
            The Rockerduck, with toppings including speck, blue cheese, truffle, and porchini definitely stands out.
            It's very flavourful Pizza for 10 €, however is sized such that a whole one is too much but half of one is a little too small."
