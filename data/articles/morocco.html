      <h3>Sahara Tour</h3>
      <p>Visiting the desert was a major appeal of going to Morocco and the best way is by a tour.
        There are many shops that offer tours in Marrakech, however we quickly learned through shopping around that they all sell the exact same packages.
        The only difference, is the price you are able to negotiate. We went for the 3 day, 2 night package and paid 1300 dirhams which is around 130â‚¬.
        A few things are not included, such as lunches on all 3 days as well as some of the stops have tour guides which ask for tips.
