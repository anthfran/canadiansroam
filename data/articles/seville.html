      <p>We were in Ibiza and wanted to go to South Portugal, the easiest way to get there was through Seville. So, we figured we would stay there for a quick 24 hour trip and we wish we stayed a bit longer. Here are some of our experiences.</p>

      <h2>The Food</h2>

      <p>We loved the food so much here that we actually had two lunches and a dinner!</p>

      Also notable, the roast "

However, we found that street to be a bit noisey and went down a side street and found this gem. The street was much more peaceful and the food was awesome, try the ceviche!"
