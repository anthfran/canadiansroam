          When I mention to other tourists that I drive a rented car in Italy, including in Rome and Amalfi Coast, they often express fear of driving in Italy. For them, it’s too intimidating because Italian drivers are too aggressive and streets are very narrow. It is very different than driving in Canada, where I'm used to driving, so I have adapted my driving style to match the locals. Here are some tips for dealing with different situations if you decide to drive in Italy.

        <h3>Signs</h3>

        <p>
          I would study all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_Italy">signs in Italy</a> before getting in a car. Most are very obvious, but others are not. In this article, I will only talk about the basics plus a few signs that confused me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Warning signs are contained in a red triangle. For example, an upcoming crossroads, dangerous turn or a lane narrowing.
        </p>

          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/warn-crossroads.png", "desc": "Crossroads"},
          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/warn-dangerousturn.png", "desc": "Dangerous Turn"},
          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/warn-roadnarrows.png", "desc": "Road Narrows"}
          ]'>
        </driving-sign-image>
        <p>
          Signs telling you what you cannot do, or a maximum, are in a red circle. Such as no overtaking, a maximum speed, do not enter or do not stop.
        </p>
        <driving-sign-image
        roadsigns='[
        {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/no-overtaking.png", "desc": "No Overtaking"},
          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/no-maxspeed.png", "desc": "Max Speed"},
          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/no-stopping.png", "desc": "No Stopping"}
          ]'>
        </driving-sign-image>
        <p>
          Signs that tell you what you must do, or to tell you how the road is changing, are in a blue circle. Such as, drive in a specific direction, a minimum speed, or drive through a roundabout.
        </p>
        <driving-sign-image
        roadsigns='[
          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/must-directions.png", "desc": "Must Go Straight or Right"},
          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/must-minspeed.png", "desc": "Minimum Speed"},
          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/must-roundabout.png", "desc": "Round About"}
          ]'>
        </driving-sign-image>
        <p>
          The last type of sign which was confusing to me at first is the strikethrough sign which means the restriction is coming to an end. These were initially confusing to me. For example, the sign of the pedestrian with a strikethrough does not mean “No Pedestrians Allowed”, it means “Pedestrian Zone Ends”.
        </p>
        <driving-sign-image
        roadsigns='[
          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/end-pedestrian.png", "desc": "End of Pedestrian Area"},
          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/end-minspeed.png", "desc": "End of Minimum Speed"},
          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/end-maxspeed.png", "desc": "End of Maximum Speed"}
          ]'>
        </driving-sign-image>

        <h3>Highway Driving</h3>

        <p>
          Italy was the first country in the world to build a fast road specifically for cars in 1921. They were the first and I think that they do it the best. The speed limit is appropriate, the roads are in perfect shape and the scenery is beautiful. Going through a tunnel and coming out the other side is always a new breathtaking view. There are a few things you should know before renting a car and driving on the Autostade in Italy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Italy, the Autostade highways, denoted by the green sign and start with an “A”, for example, the “A1”, have a speed limit of 130 km/hour. If you find yourself on another divided highway, which has a blue sign and not an “A” Autostade, the limit is 110 km/hour. Personally, I think these speed limits are great especially since I have always thought the 100 km/hour speed limit imposed on Canadian highways is too slow.
        </p>
        <driving-sign-image
        roadsigns='[
          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/highway-green.png", "desc": "Green sign for A-Series Highway with a speed limit of 130km/h"},
          {"src": "/data/images/roadsigns/highway-blue.png", "desc": "Blue sign for Highway with a speed limit of 110km/h"}
          ]'>
        </driving-sign-image>
        <p>
          You will see many people driving well over this speed, however, as a tourist with no ability to reason with the Police, I found cruising at the speed limit to be perfect. Also, there are many checkpoints where your average speed is checked. So be sure that your average speed is 130 km/hour, not only the speed going through the checkpoints.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not comfortable driving the speed limit, that’s perfectly okay in Italy. Make sure you at least drive the minimum speed limit which will be a number in a blue circle. Also, make sure you stay in the right most lane, quick drivers will go around you.
        </p>
        <p>
          A rule that is always observed on highways in Italy, stay in the right or middle lane unless you are passing. Even if you’re going the speed limit and you think nobody should be going faster, you should still stay to the right.
        </p>

        <h3>Rome</h3>

        <p>
          Rome is one place in Italy I would drive as little as possible, from the parking lot of the rental company and straight out of the city is all the driving I do in Rome. If you don’t know the streets or where you are going, driving is a two person job. One person to drive and the other person to navigate. Street names are hardly visible while driving and GPS doesn’t always give you the best voice directions. You don’t want to be distracted by a screen since there is a lot going outside your car.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often, there are no lanes in Rome. Just pick a side, preferably one that will make your next turn easier, and try and drive predictably. People will try and cut you off all the time to get in front, 
        </p>

        <h3>Roundabouts</h3>
        <p>
          There are barely any roundabouts in Canada, for some reason they aren’t liked by Canadians, however, I think they are great. There’s nothing worse than sitting at a red light with no cars driving in the other direction with the green light. Roundabouts keep people moving and I think that’s a great thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you find yourself coming up to a roundabout, you yield to traffic already in the roundabout. You do not have to fully stop unless necessary to yield. When in the roundabout, position your car so other drivers can predict where you are going. For example, if you’re taking the third exit, drive on the inside of the circle for the first two exits.
        </p>

        <h3>Amalfi Coast</h3>

        <p>
          There are very narrow roads which you have to share with tour buses, pedestrians, motorbikes, tourists who are as clueless as you are, and aggressive Italian drivers who are tailgating you waiting for that opportunity to pass.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, driving really is not that difficult here if you are patient and look ahead. If you see a bus coming, try to meet them near a straighter or wider bit of road. If you’re nervous, pull over to the right as far as you can and let the expert bus driver pass you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driving at night can be a little scary difficult there are no lights in some areas, and your front lights will be shining straight while you need to look right to make a hairpin turn. Just take your time and go slow. If someone is tailgating you because you're going slow, just pull over to let them pass.
        </p>

        <p>
          Driving in Italy is challenging and fun, and I hope you can learn from my experiences. Overall I enjoy it more than driving in Canada, don't be intimidated, give it a try and maybe you'll enjoy it too.
