          When I mention to other tourists that I am driving a rented car in Italy, including Rome and Amalfi Coast, they often say they are too scared to drive in Italy. For them, it’s too intimidating and Italian drivers are too aggressive. For me, it is very different than driving in Canada and I’ve adapted my driving style to match the locals. Here are some tips for dealing with different situations and places if you decide to drive in Italy.
        </p>

        <h3>Signs</h3>

        <p>
          I would study all the signs in Italy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_Italy) before getting in a car. Most are very obvious, but others are not. In this article, I will only talk about the basics plus a few signs that confused me.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a sign is a red triangle, it’s a warning of something up coming. Such as, an upcoming crossroads, dangerous turn or a lane narrowing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the sign is a red circle, it’s telling you what you cannot do. Such as no overtaking, a maximum speed, do not enter or do not stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the sign is a blue circle, it’s telling you what you must do. Such as, drive in a specific direction, a minimum speed, or drive through a roundabout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last type of sign which was confusing to me at first is the strikethrough which means the zone is coming to an end. For example, my initial thought was the sign of the pedestrian with a strikethrough does not mean “No Pedestrians Allowed”, it means “Pedestrian Zone Ends”.

        <h3>Highway Driving</h3>

        <p>
          Italy was the first country in the world to build a fast road specifically for cars in 1921. They were the first and they do it the best. The speed limit is appropriate, the roads are in perfect shape and the scenery is beautiful. Going through a tunnel and coming out the other side is always a new breathtaking view. Here are some things you should know before renting a car and driving on the Autostade in Italy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Highway driving is a pleasure for me, especially since I have always thought the 100 km/hour speed limit on Canadian highways is too slow. In Italy, the Autostade highways, denoted by the green sign and start with an “A”, for example, the “A1”, have a speed limit of 130 km/hour. If you find yourself on another divided highway, which has a blue sign and not an “A” Autostade, the limit is 110 km/hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will see many people driving well over this speed, however, as a tourist with no ability to reason with the Police, I found cruising at the speed limit to be perfect. Also, there are many checkpoints where your average speed is checked. So be sure that your average speed is 130 km/hour, not only the speed going through the checkpoints.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not comfortable driving the speed limit, that’s perfectly okay in Italy. Make sure you at least drive the minimum speed limit which will be a number in a blue circle. Also, make sure you stay in the right most lane, quick drivers will go around you.
        </p>
        <p>
          A rule that is always observed on highways in Italy, stay in the right or middle lane unless you are passing. Even if you’re going the speed limit and you think nobody should be going faster, you should still stay to the right.
        </p>

        <h3>Rome</h3>

        <p>
          Rome is one place in Italy I would drive as little as possible, from the parking lot of the rental company and straight out of the city. If you don’t know the streets or where you are going, driving is a two person job. One person to drive and the other person to navigate. Street names are hardly visible while driving and GPS doesn’t always give you the best voice directions. You don’t want to be distracted by a screen since there is a lot going outside your car.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often, there are no lanes in Rome. Just pick a side, preferably one that will make your next turn easier, and try and drive predictably.
        </p>

        <h3>Roundabouts</h3>
        <p>
          There are barely any roundabouts in Canada, for some reason they aren’t liked by Canadians, however, I think they are great. There’s nothing worse than sitting at a red light with no cars driving in the other direction with the green light. Roundabouts keep people moving and I think that’s a great thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you find yourself coming up to a roundabout, you yield to traffic already in the roundabout. You do not have to fully stop unless necessary to yield. When in the roundabout, position your car so other drivers can predict where you are going. For example, if you’re taking the third exit, drive on the inside of the circle for the first two exits.
        </p>

        <h3>Amalfi Coast</h3>

        <p>
          There are very narrow roads which you have to share with tour buses, pedestrians, motorbikes, tourists who are as clueless as you are, and aggressive Italian drivers who are tailgating you waiting for that opportunity to pass.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, driving really is not that difficult here if you are patient and look ahead. If you see a bus coming, try to meet them near a straighter or wider bit of road. If you’re nervous, pull over to the right as far as you can and let the expert bus driver pass you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driving at night can be a little scary difficult there are no lights in some areas, and your front lights will be shining straight while you need to look right to make a hairpin turn. Just take your time and go slow. If someone is tailgating you because you're going slow, just pull over to let them pass.
        </p>

        <p>
          Driving in Italy is challenging and fun, and I hope you can learn from my experiences. Overall I enjoy it more than driving in Canada, don't be intimidated, give it a try and maybe you'll enjoy it too.
